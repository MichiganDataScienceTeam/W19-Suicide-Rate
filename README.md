 $ cd suicide-rate  
 $ git checkout -b <name_of_your_new_branch>  
 $ git push origin <your_branch_name>   # use this command to push to your branch and any files to the master  
 $ git pull origin <your_branch_name>   # use this command to pull to your branch  
 $ git checkout master                  # use this command to navigate out of your branch and back to the master
